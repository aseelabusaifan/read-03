Java expressions and operators including assignment

Comparison operators
A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value  
* Arithetic :An arithmetic operator takes numerical values
* bitwise:A bitwise operator treats their operands& bitwise shift operators take two operand
* Logical:Conceptually, the bitwise logical operators work logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values
 * String:In addition to the comparison operators

## Loops and iteration
When you want to repeat something we are going to use one we know many time the code need to run
**different kinds of loops**,but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times.
(Note that it's possible that number could be zero!)

The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop.
There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.
