 * it`s about story Julia Rozovsky she didnt know what she wanted.
 she knew for certain was that she wanted to find a job that was more social. 
and after that She applied to business schools and was accepted by the Yale School of Management..
Instead, Rozovsky’s study group was a source of stress. ‘‘I always felt like I had to prove myself,’’ she said. The team’s dynamics could put her on edge. When the group met, teammates sometimes jockeyed for the leadership position or criticized one another’s ideas. There were conflicts over who was in charge and who got to represent the group in class. ‘‘People would try to show authority by speaking louder or talking over each other,’’ Rozovsky told me. ‘‘I always felt like I had to be careful not to make mistakes around them.’’
