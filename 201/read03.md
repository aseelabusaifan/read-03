 # HTML elements
  are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).  They also provide semantic information ( e.g. where emphasis should be placed , the definition of any acronyms used , when given text is a quotation

 ## There are lots of occasions when we need to use lists . HTML provides us with three different types :
 * Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered . For example , the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order , or a legal contract where each point needs be identified by a section number , *Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point rather than characters that indicate order ) . 
 * Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms .

 There are properties to control the choice of font , size , weight , style , and spacing . There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed . If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options , but you need to have the right license to use them . You can control the space between lines of text , individual letters , and words . Text can also be aligned to the left , right center , or justified . It can also be indented . You can use pseudo - classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text , or when they have visited a link

( You learn how the class attribute is set in Chapter 5. ) is rare that you would want to write the words true or false into the page for the user to read but this data type does have two very popular uses : First , Boolcans are used when the value can only be true / false , You could also think of these values as on / off or 0/1 true is equivalent to on or 1 false is equivalent to off or 0 Second , Booleans are used when your code can take more than one path Rernemb…
