# CSS Website Layout


A website is often divided into headers, menus, content and a footer:


There are tons of different layout designs to choose from. However, the structure  is one of the most common, and we will take a closer look at it in this tutorial.


# Header
A header is usually located at the top of the website (or right below a top navigation menu). It often contains a logo or the website name:

Example
.header {
  background-color: #F1F1F1;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 20px;
}

# Navigation Bar
A navigation bar contains a list of links to help visitors navigating through your website:


/* The navbar container */
.topnav {
  overflow: hidden;
  background-color: #333;
}

/* Navbar links */
.topnav a {
  float: left;
  display: block;
  color: #f2f2f2;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 14px 16px;
  text-decoration: none;
}

/* Links - change color on hover */
.topnav a:hover {
  background-color: #ddd;
  color: black;


  # Content
The layout in this section, often depends on the target users. The most common layout is one (or combining them) of the following:

1-column (often used for mobile browsers)
2-column (often used for tablets and laptops)
3-column layout (only used for desktops)
