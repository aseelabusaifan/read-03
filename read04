 ## Input Output in plain JavaScript

 Traditionally JavaScript was used inside web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Opera, or Safari. The author would include some JavaScript code in the HTML page the user receives when she visits a web site. That JavaScript code would run in the browser (what we call "client side", as opposed to running on the web server which is called "server side").

** major parts of what we usually refer to as "JavaScript"**
*The language itself.
*The DOM API - how the language can interact
*The server API

lets`s to get example:
var a =0;
var b = 3;
var x =a + b;
